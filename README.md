# SQL-Portfolio-Project----EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-

**Initial Data Exploration:** The project starts with a general overview of the data, including extracting basic statistics such as maximum total layoffs and examining the distribution of percentage layoffs. <br /> 
**Identification of Companies with 100% Layoffs:** Companies that experienced complete layoffs (100%) are identified, potentially indicating businesses that went out of operation. <br /> 
**Analysis by Funding Raised:** Companies with 100% layoffs are further examined based on the funds they raised, offering insights into the financial scale of these failed ventures. <br /> 
**Grouping and Aggregation:** More complex analyses involve grouping the data by various attributes such as company, location, country, year, industry, and stage of the company. This helps in understanding the distribution of layoffs across different categories. <br /> 
**Trend Analysis:** Layoffs are analyzed over time, both annually and monthly, to identify any patterns or trends in the frequency and scale of layoffs. <br /> 
**Comparative Analysis:** Companies with the largest layoffs are identified, both in terms of single-day layoffs and total layoffs over the dataset's duration. <br /> 
**Advanced Queries:** More sophisticated queries are performed using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions to delve deeper into the data, such as identifying top companies with layoffs over multiple years and calculating rolling totals of layoffs per month. <br /> 
<br />
Overall, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the layoffs dataset through systematic exploratory analysis, uncovering insights that could be valuable for further research or decision-making purposes, such as understanding industry trends, evaluating startup success rates, or assessing economic impacts.
